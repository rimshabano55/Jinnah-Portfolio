    <h2>Jinnah in 1940</h2>
    <p>
      By 1940, <strong>Jinnah</strong> had come to believe that the Muslims of
      the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible
      marginalised status they may gain in an
      <em>independent Hinduâ€“Muslim state.</em> In that year, the Muslim League,
      led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation
      for Indian Muslims.
