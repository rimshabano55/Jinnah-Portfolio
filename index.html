      <h2>Muhammad Ali Jinnah:</h2>
      <p>
        <em><strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong></em> born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai
        25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948 was a barrister, politician and the
        founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim
        League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and
        then as the Dominion of Pakistan's<em
          ><strong> first governor-general</strong></em
        >
        until his death.
      </p>
      <h2>Family and Childhood:</h2>
      <p>
        Jinnah's given name at birth was<strong>Mahomedali Jinnahbhai</strong>
        and he likely was born in 1876 to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife
        <strong>Mithibai</strong>, in a rented apartment on the second floor of
        Wazir Mansion near Karachi, now in Sindh, Pakistan but then within the
        Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's paternal grandfather was
        from Paneli Moti village in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in
        Gujarat, India).
      </p>
      <h2>Education in England:</h2>
      <p>
        In 1892, Sir <em>Frederick Leigh Croft,</em> a business associate of
        <strong>Jinnahbhai Poonja</strong>, offered young Jinnah a London
        apprenticeship with his firm,
        <strong>Graham's Shipping and Trading Company.</strong> He accepted the
        position despite the opposition of his mother, who before he left, had
        him enter an arranged marriage with his cousin, two years his junior
        from the ancestral village of Paneli, Emibai Jinnah. Jinnah's mother and
        first wife both died during his absence in England.During his student
        years in England, Jinnah was influenced by <strong>19-century</strong>
        <em>British liberalism </em> , like many other future Indian
        independence leaders. His main intellectual references were peoples like
        Bentham, Mill, Spencer, and Comte.This political education included
        exposure to the idea of the democratic nation, and progressive politics
      </p>
      <h2>Legal and early Political career:</h2>

      <h3>Barrister:</h3>

      <p>
        At the age of 20, Jinnah began his practice in Bombay, the only Muslim
        barrister in the city. English had become his principal language and
        would remain so throughout his life. His first three years in the law,
        from <strong>1897 to 1900</strong>, brought him few briefs. His first
        step towards a brighter career occurred when the acting Advocate General
        of
        <em
          >Bombay, John Molesworth MacPherson, invited Jinnah to work from his
          chambers.</em
        >
      </p>
      <h3>Rising Leader:</h3>
      <p>
        In 1857, many Indians had risen in revolt against British rule. In the
        aftermath of the conflict, some Anglo-Indians, as well as Indians in
        Britain, called for greater self-government for the subcontinent,
        resulting in the founding of the<em><strong>Indian National Congress in 1885.</strong></em>
        
      </p>
      <h3>Farewell to Congress:</h3>
      <p>Jinnah moderate faction in the Congress was undermined by the deaths of<em>Mehta and Gokhale in 1915</em> ; he was further isolated by the fact that Naoroji was in London, where he remained until his death in 1917. Nevertheless, Jinnah worked to bring the Congress and League together. In <strong>1916</strong>, with Jinnah now president of the Muslim League, the two organisations signed the Lucknow Pact, setting quotas for Muslim and Hindu representation in the various provinces. Although the pact was never fully implemented, its signing ushered in a period of co-operation between the Congress and the League.</p>
      <h2>Return To Politics:</h2>
      <p>The early 1930s saw a resurgence in Indian Muslim nationalism, which came to a head with the Pakistan Declaration. <strong>In 1933, Indian Muslims </strong>, especially from the United Provinces, began to urge Jinnah to return and take up again his leadership of the Muslim League,an organisation which had fallen into inactivity. He remained titular president of the League,but declined to travel to India to preside over its<strong> 1933 session in April</strong> , writing that he could not possibly return there until the end of the year.
     </p>
     <h2>Struggle For Pakistan:</h2>
     <p>Until the late 1930s, most Muslims of the <em>British Raj </em> expected, upon independence, to be part of a unitary state encompassing all of British India, as did the Hindus and others who advocated self-government.Despite this, other nationalist proposals were being made. In a speech given at Allahabad to a League session in 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal called for a state for Muslims in British India. <em>Choudhary Rahmat Ali</em> published a pamphlet in 1933 advocating a state <b>"Pakistan"</b> in the Indus Valley, with other names given to Muslim-majority areas elsewhere in India. Jinnah and Iqbal corresponded in 1936 and 1937; in subsequent years, <strong>Jinnah credited Iqbal as his mentor, </strong> and used Iqbal's imagery and rhetoric in his speeches.</p>
     <h2>Second World War and Lahore Resolution:</h2>
     <p>On 3 September <strong>1939,</strong><em>British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain</em> announced the commencement of war with Nazi Germany. The following day, the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, without consulting Indian political leaders, announced that India had entered the war along with Britain. There were widespread protests in India.After meeting with Jinnah and with Gandhi, Linlithgow announced that negotiations on self-government were suspended for the duration of the war.To come up with such a position, the League's Working Committee met for four days in February <b>1940</b>to set out terms of reference to a constitutional sub-committee. The Working Committee asked that the sub-committee return with a proposal that would result in<em>"independent dominions in direct relationship with Great Britain"</em> where Muslims were dominant. </p>

     <h2>Mountbatten And Independence:</h2>
     <p>On 20 February 1947, Attlee announced <i>Mountbatten's</i> appointment, and that Britain would transfer power in India not later than June <b>1948</b>. Mountbatten took office as Viceroy on 24 March 1947, two days after his arrival in India. By then, the Congress had come around to the idea of partition.<b>On 14 August</b>, Pakistan became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, "here indeed is Pakistan's King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam."</p>
    <p>"That's the end of that.</p>
     <p id="Golden-words">"You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan ... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State . I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State".</p>
    <h2>Governor General:</h2>
    <p>The <i>Radcliffe Commission</i>, dividing Bengal and Punjab, completed its work and reported to Mountbatten on 12 August; the last Viceroy held the maps until the 17th, not wanting to spoil the independence celebrations in both nations.Mohammed Ali Jinnah was the founder and first governor-general (1947–48) of Pakistan. He is revered as the father of Pakistan. He also sought the political union of Hindus and Muslims, which earned him the title of <strong>“the best ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity"</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Death:</h2>
 <p> Jinnah died later that night at 10:20 pm at his home in Karachi on <srong>11 September 1948 at the age of 71</srong>, just over a year after Pakistan's creation.</p>
  <p>Jinnah was buried on <strong>12 September 1948</strong> amid official mourning in Pakistan; a million people gathered for his funeral led by Shabbir Ahmad Usmani.Today, Jinnah rests in a large marble mausoleum,<b>Mazar-e-Quaid</b>, in Karachi</p>
